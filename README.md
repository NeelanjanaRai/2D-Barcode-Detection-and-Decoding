# BarCodeVision: Intelligent 2D Barcode Detection and Decoding

BarCodeVision is a robust Python-based project designed to detect and decode 2D barcodes (like QR codes and Data Matrix) using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Powered by YOLOv8 for object detection and Pyzbar for barcode decoding, this project is ideal for applications in logistics, inventory management, and die-level traceability.
