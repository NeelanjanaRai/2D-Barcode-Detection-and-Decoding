# YOLO Object Detection

Object detection is a computer vision technique for identifying and localizing objects within an image or a video.

## Image Localization

Image localization is the process of identifying the correct location of one or multiple objects using **bounding boxes**, which correspond to rectangular shapes around the objects. 

This process is sometimes confused with **image classification** or **image recognition**, which aims to predict the class of an image or an object within an image into one of the categories or classes.

# What Makes YOLO the right choice for this task?

Some of the reasons why YOLO is right match:

- **Speed**  
  YOLO is incredibly fast, making it ideal for real-time object detection.

- **Detection Accuracy**  
  YOLO delivers high accuracy, identifying and localizing objects effectively.

- **Good Generalization**  
  YOLO generalizes well across different datasets and environments, making it versatile and robust.
